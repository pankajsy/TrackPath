# TrackPath
Location Tracking App
A mini Android App project to track ones path from location A to location B using Google Maps API featuring in following attributes:
Mark your Location, Zoom Controls, Start - Stop tracking, Save to local SQLite DB, View History, Clear the Map.

Future scope: Implement Geo-fencing API to show distance, speed, time of the track traced. Snap to road API - to map the co-ordinates to the nearest roads for better tracking.
